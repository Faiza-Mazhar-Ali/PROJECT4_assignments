# Problem Statement
# Write a function that takes two numbers and finds the average between the two.

# Starter Code
# def main():
#     print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# # This provided line is required at the end of
# # Python file to call the main() function.
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()
# Solution
# def average(a: float, b: float):
#     """
#     Returns the number which is half way between a and b
#     """
#     sum = a + b
#     return sum / 2

# def main():
#     avg_1 = average(0, 10)
#     avg_2 = average(8, 10)
    
#     final = average(avg_1, avg_2)
#     print("avg_1", avg_1)
#     print("avg_2", avg_2)
#     print("final", final)
    

# # There is no need to edit code beyond this point

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()
