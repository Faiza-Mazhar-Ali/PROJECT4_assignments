# Problem Statement
# Fill out the get_name() function to return your name as a string! We've written a main() function for you which calls your function to retrieve your name and then prints it in a greeting.

# Here's a sample run of the program where the name we've decided to return is Sophia (the autograder expects the returned name to be Sophia):

# Howdy Sophia ! ðŸ¤ 

# Starter Code
# def main():
#     print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# # This provided line is required at the end of
# # Python file to call the main() function.
# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()
# Solution
# def get_name():
#     return "Sophia"

# # There is no need to edit code beyond this point

# def main():
#     name = get_name() # get_name() will return a string which we store to the 'name' variable here
#     print("Howdy", name, "! ðŸ¤ ")

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     main()






# #05_get_name.md
def fetch_name():
    # Hardcoded return as required by the problem
    name_str = "Sophia"
    return name_str

def main():
    # Instead of directly calling inside print, store and print separately
    my_name = fetch_name()
    print("Howdy " + my_name + " ! ðŸ¤ ")

# Standard Python entry point
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
